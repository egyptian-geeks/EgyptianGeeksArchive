How Egyptian software companies charge clients ? Do we consider Dollar price into out calculations ? Is there any other way of determining the cost of software ?\n\nAnother question, \nFor a fresh graduate software engineer in Egypt how can I decide if I'm being offered a fair salary when I cant find such available statistics?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-02-25T14:27:43+11:00","total_likes":13,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1399591190080585","from":{"name":"Amr ELsaqqa","id":"10155181258139701"},"message":null,"caption":null,"description":"برمج لعبة شطرنج من الصفر باستخدام C++\n#Emad_Jabbour\n#CPP","created_time":"2017-02-25T04:41:44+11:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":8}]}

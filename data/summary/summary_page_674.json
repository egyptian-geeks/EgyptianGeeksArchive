For the first time in Udacity’s history, this doesn’t just mean subtitling the videos, but actually adapting all of the courses’ content to one specific region.\n\nGoogle will offer 2,000 scholarships for students in Egypt and host job fairs and sessions for students there. Thrun noted that Udacity sees Egypt as a great stepping stone to bring the course to students around the Arabic-speaking peninsula and that bringing good education — and the good jobs it will hopefully enable students to get — “could reduce the number of wars” in the area.","caption":"techcrunch.com","description":"At its I/O developer conference in San Francisco, Google today announced that it has partnered with Udacity to launch a six-course Android development..","created_time":"2015-05-29T06:40:38+10:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_947814975258211","from":{"name":"Osama Soliman","id":"709206249239999"},"message":"Should I upgrade to the New Windows 10 ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-05-29T04:26:19+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":7},{"id":"172338516139198_948400461866329","from":{"name":"Omar Ibrahim","id":"10113230069002554"},"message":"Learn Node.js by Building 10 Projects:\n\n1- Simple Web Server\n2- Basic Express Site (Express, Jade, and Nodemailer)\n3- User Login System (Express, and MongoDB)\n4- Blog Website (Express, and MongoDB)\n5- Survey App (Express, and Cassandra)\n6- Bookstore (Express, Mongo DB, and Paypal)\n7- Social App (Express and MongoDB)\n8- Event List using MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular.js, and Node.js) \n9- Restaurant App (Express and MySQL)\n10- Collaboration App (Keystone)\n\nThey course typically sells for $199 is available for $19 at TNW Deals!\n\nhttps://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/learn-nodejs-by-building-10-projects?rid=2047764","caption":"youtube.com","description":"A Complete Guide to Master JavaScript Server Programming and its frameworks including NoSQL database systems Klink: http://adf.ly/1A7qmj If you want to tell ...","created_time":"2015-05-30T16:56:05+10:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_948626031843772","from":{"name":"Sameh Saeed","id":"10154266644607344"},"message":"good to follow if you are interested in AngularJS\n","caption":"flipboard.com","description":"By Dan Wahlin | All about Angular!

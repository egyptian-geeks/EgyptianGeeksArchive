I worked on a lot of projects including the web platform for Concerned Joe and I released an opensource version of the whole thing. We self-fund ourselves by freelancing on oDesk.\n\nI got an internship at eSpace last July and right now I'm working on the project we were working on then. It's an iOS game made using Swift. It's also a clone of another game I created earlier using ActionScript 3 during NewGrounds Game Jam 9.\n\nThere are a lot of other stuff to add but I'd rather keep it short. So yea, who'd like to AMA?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-01-07T06:50:05+11:00","total_likes":9,"total_comments":25}]}

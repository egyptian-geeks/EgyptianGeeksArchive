It shows the ability to use a single model to translate language pairs that the model has never been trained for. For example, training the model with Korean<->English, and Japanese<->English, allows direct (zero-shot) translation between Korean<->Japanese, without changing the model. \n\nThe article cites this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04558v1.pdf and they have nice visualizations and possibly new insights about what the model is actually \"learning\" about the language (semantics vs direct phrase/phrase translation).

The first one is a decoder that produces its output into a directory , if the number of the output files in that directory exceeded X files i wait, the other thread is another decoder that reads the file and use it as input, when its done decoding it eliminates the file. \n\nThis problem is similar to the producer consumer problem, i firstly implemented its code and then modified the condition to work on the problem by sharing the Num_of_folders as the global variable instead of qeue, \n\ni.e: The first decoder is now the producer which writes until X num of files, the second one is consumer which reads the files decode and then remove it. \n\nThe problem that the producer thread always write files even if the condition.wait() is applied that means both threads are not working synchronously. \n\nCan anyone help me with this porblem or can provide another solution instead of consumer/producer algorithm?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-03-07T00:54:30+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1411019268937777","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abdul Fatah","id":"10211954222794711"},"message":"if anyone can help \n\n","caption":"stackoverflow.com","description":"currently we are using design and support libs 23.1.1 , when i updated to 25 there is a big gap in the layout and i can't figure out why unfortunately i need more reputation to post links , all the","created_time":"2017-03-07T01:29:22+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1411122348927469","from":{"name":"Ahmed Adel Radwan","id":"10212318670431489"},"message":"WOW!","caption":null,"description":"Saw this chart on Twitter today.

This also can be included for the ITI intake.\n\nWhat I'm concerned about it the the GIS track\nGis stands for geographical information systems which you can study as part of geography science in faculty of arts and requires a heavy understanding of geography so you can work in it. It's our science and our tools.\nBut yet we can't apply for it lol , it's for engineering collages graduates whether if it's civil or whatever... who runs this shit ?!!!\n\nWhy do u guys \" geeks\" support such retard systems ? Regardless of gis no one out side the engineering area can apply to learn development for example !!

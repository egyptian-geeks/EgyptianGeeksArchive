Very nice one to watch.\n\nYou also are an awesome writer. The article flow is very easy to follow, even in the one big paragraph in the middle.\n\nOn that side, one comment I would have for improving it even further, is adding a little bit of intro at the beginning. I got confused by the opening talking about the second thing and the first thing and I wasn't sure what was up. I didn't realize this was a series till the end. You might want to explain that up front.\n\nAgain, overall, great work. Keep it up 👍","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1276544662385239"},{"created_time":"2016-11-01T11:43:56+0000","from":{"name":"Mona Shokrof","id":"10154886702266007"},"message":"Thanks alot","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1276554595717579"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEkzTmpVME5EWTJNak00TlRJek9Ub3hORGMzT1RrNU56Y3kZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEkzTmpVMU5EVTVOVGN4TnpVM09Ub3hORGM0TURBd05qTTMZD"}}}}

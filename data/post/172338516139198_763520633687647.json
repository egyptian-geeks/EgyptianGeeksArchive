Some languages do support traits out of the box others build around mixins. Ruby uses mixins, Scala has beautiful support for traits (and behaviours)\n\nOthers like Rust, D (with an extension), Python (a package for traits), Javascript delegations and possibly quite a few others.\n\nYou might also want to look at the decorator pattern.","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"763526760353701"},{"created_time":"2014-06-12T22:06:50+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"But to answer your question, restrictions per inheritance?

Inheritance eventually extends the behavior of an object, it doesn't swap implementations and that's the intention of a strategy pattern.\n\nDecorators attach extra responsibilities to an object, hence dubbed an alternative to subclassing.\n\nIn layman's terms, if you're extending functionality then decorate, if you're replacing functionality then go for the strategy pattern.

If you want to inherit foo but not bar, then both are two different things. In this case you should put foo in a class D & bar in a class E. B inherits D. C inherits E. A inherits D & E.\n\nThere languages which allows multiple inheritance (C++ & Python). Others implement it with mixins (Ruby).\n\nIn C#, you can get around this using interfaces + extension methods. To apply it to the above example: D & E will be interfaces, then you should create DeeExtensions containing an extension method foo & EeeExtensions containing extension method bar.\n\nWhat if you can't control A? You can make B inherit from it, then override bar to throw an NotImplementedException. If you're using a dynamic language (e.g. Python), you can remove the method from the class.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"763719757001068"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOell6TlRJMk56WXdNelV6TnpBeE9qRTBNREkyTVRBMU5EVT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOell6TnpFNU56VTNNREF4TURZANE9qRTBNREkyTkRRNE5qWT0ZD"}}}}

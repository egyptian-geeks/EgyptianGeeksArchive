It's clever marketing.\nYou already got backers who will pay to get your product on the market. You don't need a Kickstarter campaign, but you do it anyway to attract attention. You make it get viral so every tech blog talks about it and you get early backers:\n\nTechnical early backers will appreciate a $9 SoC that is able to run Linux. Currently it can't run the mainline kernel so they need people to contribute to this.\nNot too technical people are more likely to purchase the expensive addons like the $15 HDMI adapter. Shipping is also quite overpriced.\n\nIf they break even money-wise, which the probably won't, they still made a very good deal:\nAmazing publicity and community-developed software.\nAfter that they can go back to business as usual and sell it at a different retail price.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"955461397826902"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVE0zTWpnek1qUTJNekV4TXpnME9qRTBNekV4TWpVMk1URT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVFUxTkRZAeE16azNPREkyT1RBeU9qRTBNek0yT1RrM01qYz0ZD"}}}}

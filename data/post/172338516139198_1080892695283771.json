That's very common.\n\nI always felt bad reading what i learned later was just unnecessarily clever code until i started becoming THE Css and Js guy in many engagements i went to at several clients with big and small teams. I stopped bothering afterwards.\n\nI would advice you to do the same. Aim to learn JS in and out, but ignore the Github metric.\n\nThe free ES6 online book is awesome. JS the good parts is a classic. Some other good books are things like the JavaScript Applications book. Those would be good places.

capable in multiple languages/dialects is good for

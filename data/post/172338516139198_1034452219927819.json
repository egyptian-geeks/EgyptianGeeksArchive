It would make sense only in case that your technical knowledge is the same or in the same level as everyone else, in that case, your interpersonal skills are what differentiate you from the norm.\n\nThat fact changes dramatically when your technical skills are making you the \"expert\" in your area of work. For example, I met several people in my career (in Microsoft for example) who are considered to be the textbook definition for the word \"asshole\" and yet they hold a very high level and they are very valuable because they have rare or exceptional technical knowledge.\n\nGenerally, once you cross a certain level of knowledge, people really don't give a damn about your personal skills because they can get you several assistants who could take care of that.\n\nOne very famous example for what I said above was Steve Jobs. I worked in a startup that he was an adviser for and I got semi-personal communications with him. You can scratch that part about personality, communication and that crap cause he really didn't give a fuck about any of it and yet, he was considered a world icon","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1034464059926635"},{"created_time":"2015-11-20T09:44:40+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"There is one important point to make clear once again here: These numbers do NOT`mean you should have %15 technical skills and 85% soft skills.\n\nThis totally depends on your role.

I have been looking for a good technical team that has experience in the open source stack and knowledge in a heterogeneous, high availability project but I still can't find them. I have budget, I want four team members in a different levels. I can't find a complete team that integrates well together and will get me the expected results. \nDid anyone face the same problem before? Shall I switch technology and start depends on the .NET stack? Shall I hire people from East Europe? I didn't start yet but I can see the risk. \nYour thoughts are highly appreciated","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1123163044390069"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1123163044390069"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-04-13T02:58:49+0000","updated_time":"2016-04-13T22:08:44+0000","shares":{"count":2},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1142904185832197","name":"Mosaab Ahmed"},{"id":"1118459391596579","name":"Mohamad Emad"},{"id":"10158193077815618","name":"Ahmed M.

Very few good ones remain and will probably not give you the results you want, plus they'll cost you higher (although you said you do have the budget for them but it's worth mentioning)... Either outsource to East Europe, India etc... if you're stuck to a certain technology, or work with local talents using what they know well (.NET stack, Java, etc...)... And one more note, comparing technologies to each other is like comparing apples to oranges...

I think technology selection is a first step before hiring the entire team. You are talking about an enterprise level project, so if there is some kind of enterprise architecture/architects, this should help in the decision.\n2. I'd start with most senior staff - usually an application architect. This individual is usually professional enough to work remotely. So the earth is open for you. Would give preference to Egypt for expansion purpose and supervising less seniors staff later.\n3. Ensure legality when hiring from other countries and how law is respected there. Ensure appropriate DNA is in place. A good pool of talents at competitive prices is available at www.upwork.com I worked some projects on elance, their previous brand, and I can say they have some of the best calibers. You can recruit part time, terminate contract anytime, all flexibility you could need.\n4. Once things are clear, you can start hiring less senior engineers from Egypt under the supervision of the architect.\n5. If applicable in your case, go agile.... meaning let your architect do a first POC, no need for a team at this stage to test things out.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1123452797694427"},{"created_time":"2016-04-13T14:26:15+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Aboulenein","id":"10158457549660438"},"message":"I also think hiring top fresh grads is most promising for long term business lines, however for single projects hiring seniors is probably better.\nFresh grads require some training, could be a few months, and usually move faster for better packages.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1123455927694114"},{"created_time":"2016-04-13T14:28:29+0000","from":{"name":"AbdAllah Khashaba","id":"850869651733894"},"message":"I can lead your team and help gathering them , if interested inbox me :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1123456677694039"},{"created_time":"2016-04-13T20:41:38+0000","from":{"name":"Hany Essam","id":"1342489319142943"},"message":"Post a challenging yet small task in advance, that will ought to filter the good and really interested ones..

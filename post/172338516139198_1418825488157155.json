Then I checked at RadioShack and there was a \"Hama\" one that cost 400 EGP!\n\nAre these prices reasonable?! :\\","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1418825488157155"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1418825488157155"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-03-12T21:30:23+0000","updated_time":"2017-03-13T18:46:42+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-03-12T21:36:14+0000","from":{"name":"Amir Abou Eesa","id":"1353018234756623"},"message":"مامون في الكوربه بس مش عارف بقت بكام دلوقتي :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1418829491490088"},{"created_time":"2017-03-12T21:39:58+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"looks like something you can buy from China","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1418831954823175"},{"created_time":"2017-03-12T22:11:33+0000","from":{"name":"يصفيد بن ذاعات","id":"245030945959317"},"message":"i guess it's a i bought a display port -> HDMI adapter for about 200 LE . brandless  :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1418852874821083"},{"created_time":"2017-03-12T22:45:10+0000","from":{"name":"Tony Raoul Iscaros","id":"10155085965723420"},"message":"try el bostan in tahrir or technology mall beside el serag mall , they have the best prices , however Souq el Asr is usually more expensive but I usually go for it as it is not worth the savings to go to tahrir or nasr city","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1418876011485436"},{"created_time":"2017-03-12T23:29:50+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Khaled","id":"1912422282377507"},"message":"Sami Hanna","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10208583554685907","length":10,"name":"Sami Hanna","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1418905211482516"},{"created_time":"2017-03-13T03:44:27+0000","from":{"name":"Amr ELsaqqa","id":"10155181258139701"},"message":"By the way the one that costs EGP 400 is not that good as you can think, it is just overpriced due to the EGP devaluation, I was at RadioShack last week checking for a car phone charger, they are starting from EGP 300!!","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1419050958134608"},{"created_time":"2017-03-13T03:52:23+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"I don't have much hardware knowledge, but looking at these convereters, they are just interface converters made in china with a small chip inside, sometimes, do you guys really think there is a major difference at least on the ones doing just basic interface conversion?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1419055828134121"},{"created_time":"2017-03-13T15:59:15+0000","from":{"name":"Sherif Abdel-Naby","id":"1231245263656767"},"message":"Mawgod fe mall el bostan fe el door el talet b 135 gneh.

The Foundations learning / University type approach, which is learning the proper foundations, history, and major theoretical concepts before diving into programming, which is of course the way to go if you want to be a professional, but you will learn a lot of stuff which might never be of use to you in the real world, but is important as a primer and is generally good know. (stuff like machine language, binary code, or even just the C programming language)\n\n2. The quick course / certificate approach, which just dives right into practical programming right from the start in the programming language that you will end up using.\n\nThe first approach is recommended, if you are not in a hurry and have the time to learn about programming properly, in which case the CS50 course you mentioned is perfect. \nAs for languages for this course, everyone should start with C, and then C++, as these languages will contain just about every concept you need to learn to move on to any other practical language in use today!","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1418130408226663"},{"created_time":"2017-03-12T06:40:55+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Atef","id":"10154405022571966"},"message":"Mina Atef M","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154782264623612","length":11,"name":"Mina Atef M","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1418213088218395"},{"created_time":"2017-03-12T07:41:10+0000","from":{"name":"Nourmina Nabil","id":"10158334707160510"},"message":"والنبي ياجماعة يعني اللي عامل share لكورس Java .. ماذا فعل من شر كي يبدأ حياته مع ال Java رفقا ..","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1418245648215139"},{"created_time":"2017-03-12T11:57:00+0000","from":{"name":"Momen Al Zalabany","id":"10158646474145144"},"message":"بص.. الغات كلها عباره عن syntax . مش ده المهم.. اي لغه ممكن تتعلمها في يومين المهم انك تبقي عارف الاساسيات.\n1.
